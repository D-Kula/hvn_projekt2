# hvn_projekt2
A project that implements the use of a DS18B20 temperature probe using a pi pico.
When powered on the system will begin outputting temperature data over USB-UART along
with the picos and temperature probes hardware IDs.


Required materials:
```
- Raspberry Pi Pico (or Pico W)
- USB-cabel for Raspberry Pi Pico
- 1-2 DS18B20 or equivalent
- 1 4.7 kOhm resistor
- Breadboard and jumper wires
```
